    Flask-HTMLBuilder
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Flask-HTMLBuilder is a Flask extension that allows flexible and easy
    Python-only generation of HTML snippets and full HTML documents using a
    robust syntax.  For more advanced usage it provides a lean template
    inheritance system that is intertwined with the Flask/Werkzeug endpoint
    mechanisms.
